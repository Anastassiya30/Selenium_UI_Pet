Like a user I want to delete my pet and create a new one with its own photo.

Pre-condition:
1. User is authorized with 'user@mail.com' login, and '3333' password;
2. There is a created pet in the user's profile.

Step to reproduce:
1. Send POST/login request with valid user's data;
2. Send DELETE/pet request by correct pet's id;
3. Send POST/pet request with filling request body to create a new pet;
4. Send POST/pet/image request to upload a photo of the pet by correct id and valid picture.

Expected result:
1. Token is taken;
2. Pet's id is taken;
3. Pet succesfully deleted;
4. New pet succesfully created;
5. Photo of a new pet succesfully saved.

Comment:
1. In response of DELETE/pet request 'Pet record has been removed' message is getting.
2. In response of POST/pet request a new pet with correct data and uploading photo from step 4 is getting.
